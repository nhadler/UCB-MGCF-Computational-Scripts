# UCB-MGCF-Computational-Scripts
A collection of scripts I have written to be used with UC Berkeley's MGCF supercluster for computational chemistry. 

**xyx2ztb** is a python script to automate batch xtb calculations. This requires a folder containing XYZ files of your molecule, and a 'com' file
containing just XTB arguments, not the XYZ file or "> out".
